    question: <span>Can I build a scene for another metaverse (ex. The Sandbox, Voxels)?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        No. For the first iteration of the Open Scenes Grant Program we will fund only Decentraland scenes. Based on
        what’s the response we could open a second iteration of the program for other metaverses.

    question: <span>Can I submit an already developed scene?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        Yes. If you have created a quality scene for Decentraland prior to the announcement of the Open Scenes Grant
        program you can submit it. You would need to agree that the scene will become open-sourced and available for the
        general public.

    question: <span>Will the users be able to customize the scenes?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        Yes. As the scenes are going to be open-sourced, that would mean that users would be able to do changes.
        LandWorks would work on providing a guide for doing basic changes to the scenes like name, links and images
        within the scene.

    id: 4,
    question: <span>Can I submit a scene for more than 1 category?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        Yes. All applications will be reviewed by our jury panel and assessed based on the scene quality, functionality
        and usability.

    id: 5,
    question: <span>Can we participate in the program as a team/company?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        Yes. Whether you are a solo builder, a team of several builders, a company or a DAO - all submissions are
        welcomed!

    id: 6,
    question: <span>Can I participate with a build done in Decentranalnd’s Builder?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        Yes you can. However you need to keep in mind that quality of the build is one of the scoring criteria of the
        jury panel therefore you would need to put in extra effort if you are using Decentraland’s Builder.

    question: <span>How will the payout happen?</span>,
    answer: (
      <span>
        The payout will happen after delivery and successful test of the scene. Funds will be transferred to the
        provided wallet in the application form.

    question: <span>Can more than 1 scene in the same category win a grant?</span>,

      <span>
        Yes. Grants are not limited to the categories. Grants will be given out until the prize pool is exhausted.
